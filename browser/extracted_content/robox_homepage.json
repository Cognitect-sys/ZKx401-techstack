  "summary": "RoboX is introduced as the first open-source data platform for robotics training, transforming smartphones into a live sensor network. Users can join data collection 'missions' by sharing anonymized data from their devices, earning points redeemable for ROBOX tokens. The platform aims to provide up-to-date, real-world data to address the issue of outdated robotics datasets. It emphasizes privacy and user control through on-device data scrubbing, encryption, open audits, and user sovereignty, allowing contributors to turn their routine activities into valuable data and rewards.",
